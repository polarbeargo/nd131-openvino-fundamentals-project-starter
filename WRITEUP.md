questions.

## Explaining Custom Layers

The process behind converting custom layers involves...

Some of the potential reasons for handling custom layers are...  

## Running the project

For running the video file
```
python3 main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m frozen_inference_graph.xml -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```  

for running a webcam  
```
python3 main.py -i CAM -m frozen_inference_graph.xml -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```  

## Comparing Model Performance

My method(s) to compare models before and after conversion to Intermediate Representations
were...

The difference between model accuracy pre- and post-conversion was...

The size of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

The inference time of the model pre- and post-conversion was...

## Assess Model Use Cases

Some of the potential use cases of the people counter app are...

1. Automate Carp Counting
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 

Each of these use cases would be useful because...
1. Automate Carp Counting - 
2. 
3. 
4.
5. 

## Assess Effects on End User Needs

Lighting, model accuracy, and camera focal length/image size have different effects on a
deployed edge model. The potential effects of each of these are as follows...

## Model Research

[This heading is only required if a suitable model was not found after trying out at least three
different models. However, you may also use this heading to detail how you converted 
a successful model.]

In investigating potential people counter models, I tried each of the following three models:

- Model 1: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
  
- Model 2: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...

- Model 3: [Name]
  - [Model Source]
  - I converted the model to an Intermediate Representation with the following arguments...
  - The model was insufficient for the app because...
  - I tried to improve the model for the app by...
